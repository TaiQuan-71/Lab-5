# Lab-5
# Executive Summary

Write up as though you are explaining this week's lab to others.
* lab 5 included software and Virtualization. I learned the difference between different types of software. The difference between cloud computing and Virtualization. I also learened the diffent ways virtualization solves problems.
# Software

Explain the roles of application, utility and operating system software. Give an example of each.
* Application Software: is the category of programs that something useful for the user ( note pad).
* Utility Software: software that allows you to fix or modify your computer in some way ( Antivirus software ).

* The purpose of virtualization is to allow users to use software that makes environments independent of physical infrastructure.
* Cloud computing differs from virtualization because it is a service that delivers shared computing resources( softwareand/or data ) on demand via the internet.
# Virtualization

What types of problems are solved with virtualization?
* Types of problems solved with virtualization include IT organizations can run run more than on virtual system, have multiple operating systems, applications on a single server, economies  of scale and greater efficiency.
What role does hypervisor play in virtualization?
* The role hypervisor play in virtualization are decouples the virtual machine from the host, dynamically allocates computing resources to each virtual machine as needed , a thin layer of software.

Follow the vmware lab to create a virtual machine and upload screenshot of successful creation of the virtual machine
